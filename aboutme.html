    <p class = "white"> Hey! My name is Phoebe Achonwa. I am 16 years 
        old and I attend MEHS. I was born in Greece and 
      I moved to the U.S. 
        when I was three years old.
        I am Nigerian. In MEHS, 
        I ran track which was pretty cool,
        and I'm going to join it again 
        next year. I joined the Girls Who Code 
      summer intermission in 2017.</p>
